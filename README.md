# Real-time Orange Circle Detection

## Overview

This project is a real-time video processing application designed to detect orange circles. Leveraging computer vision techniques and utilizing the OpenCV library, the system identifies and tracks orange circles within a video stream. The goal is to provide a simple yet effective solution for real-time object detection, with a specific focus on detecting orange circles in dynamic environments.

## Features

- **Real-time Processing:** The application processes video frames in real-time, making it suitable for applications requiring immediate feedback.
  
- **Orange Circle Detection:** The algorithm is optimized to identify and track orange circles within the video stream, offering robust performance even in challenging lighting conditions.

- **OpenCV Integration:** The project is built using the OpenCV library, a popular open-source computer vision and machine learning library, ensuring reliability and ease of use.
